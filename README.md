A Flutter package that implements an Accessible Design System, a toolkit and starting point designed for creating fully accessible web and mobile interfaces. As a part of my dissertation project for my Computer Engineering degree, this system adheres to the principles outlined in the Atomic Design methodology. It is especially tailored to meet the needs of users with various disabilities, ensuring inclusive and universal access to digital content.

## Features

- Contrast Checking Tool: This integral feature allows developers to automatically verify the contrast between colors used in each widget, ensuring optimal readability and compliance with accessibility standards.

- Fully Accessible Widgets: Every widget in this system has been meticulously crafted to be fully accessible. This includes proper screen reader support, captions for all media including images, and navigational aids for keyboard-only users.

- Adherence to Atomic Design Principles: Structured following the Atomic Design methodology, this design system allows for the creation of both simple and complex UI elements with accessibility at their core.

- Customizable and Extendable: Designed to be flexible, the system can be easily adapted and extended to fit various design needs and preferences.

- Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed documentation is provided to guide users through the features and capabilities of the system.

## Getting started
Import and use it as a Flutter package.


## Additional information
This is an open-source project and welcomes contributions from the community. It is well-rounded but intends to act mostly as a starting point and guide to whatever you are building. Whether it's improving the documentation, adding new features, or reporting issues, your input is valuable. 

This project represents not just a culmination of my academic journey in Computer Engineering but also my commitment to making the digital world more accessible to everyone. By using and contributing to the repository, you're joining an effort to create a more inclusive digital future.
